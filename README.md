# TO DO

Input Validation: The script does not perform any validation on user input. For example, in the signup route, user inputs are directly used to create a new user. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. Consider using Flask-WTF or a similar library to validate form inputs.

Error Handling: The script currently does not include error handling. There should be proper error handlers to deal with unexpected server errors.

Session Timeout: There is currently no timeout for sessions. This means a user could stay logged in indefinitely, which is a potential security risk.

User Authentication: Right now, the only user authentication in place is checking the username and password during login. Consider implementing more robust user authentication, such as email confirmation or two-factor authentication.

Code Modularity: To make the code more maintainable, you could consider separating the different parts of the app into different files. For example, you could move the database models to a separate file, and the routes to another file.

Secure Secret Key: The secret key is hard-coded in the script. It would be better to set it through an environment variable, and definitely avoid publishing it in the code.

Chat Functionality: The chat function is currently not implemented. You may want to use Flask-SocketIO to implement real-time messaging.

Password Reset Functionality: Currently, there is no way for a user to reset their password if they forget it. Implementing a password reset function would be a good idea.

These are some potential improvements you could make. If you want help with implementing any of these or other features, please provide more specific requirements.
